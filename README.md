#Mitr Font

Mitr means friend.

Mitr is a Sans Latin & Loopless Thai typeface that combines senses of Organic and Humanist Sans Serif with rounded terminal. It has a wide structure and airy negative space but also preserve legibility and readability. Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazine, and poster.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal one, so this allows designers to extend the font to black weight and more in some cases.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.
